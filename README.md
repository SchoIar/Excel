# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains original solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require creative problem-solving and programming skills. The solutions are developed by Anton Ilic.

## Disclaimer

All the code in this repository is original and not copied from any other source on the internet, unless otherwise indicated. Naturally, some of the logic may seem similar to code from other similar Project Euler repositories on GitHub.

## Usage

Each problem is solved in a separate folder, named according to the problem number (e.g., `Problem-1`, `Problem-2`). To run a solution, execute the following within the file's folder:
`python3 problemName.py`

## Contributing
If you have any suggestions, optimizations, or alternative solutions, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. Constructive feedback is always appreciated.

## License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code as needed.

## Project Euler Guidelines

According to the Project Euler [About page](https://projecteuler.net/about):

> "There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, that will rarely be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.

However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. "

Please respect the spirit of Project Euler by using these solutions for learning and discussion purposes only and not for sharing with others who have not yet solved the problems themselves. Attempt to solve the problems on your own first, and only refer to these solutions for guidance or inspiration.
