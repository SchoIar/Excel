Compliation information with example program `hello.cpp`
**Compilation Command**: `g++ hello.cpp`
or to name the output file a certain way: `g++ hello.cpp -o hello.o`

To execute the program, simply add the file name to the run argument, for example if your executable was named "hello.o" the way to run the algorithm on a dataset in the file "data.txt" would be:

**Execute Instructions**: `./hello.o data.txt`
